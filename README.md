This will be a short episode of a one-episode album called MyRecipes, which seems to be just a recipe page on a dessert I happen to be thinking of and really love (although the loving part is pretty obvious). Hope you enjoy this short saga on carrot cake, even though I hate cream cheese and still eat it all the time.
